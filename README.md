# msgGenerator

Using only JS, develop a random message generator when the script runs. 
The project from Codecademy is freeform, so the generated message can be of any thematic choice.

I will be creating a barbarian warcry generator that will provide a free, random, unique warcry for you!
There may or may not be some hidden *legendary* warcries--

This may not be the most useful script, but I figure something like this may find some use in an RPG Battle Dialogue generator. Probably not the way it is. But that's the idea!
